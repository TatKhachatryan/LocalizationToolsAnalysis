# LocalizationToolsAnalysis
This project focuses on analyzing reviews for 6 companies: Crowdin, Lokalise, Smartcat, Transifex, Murf.ai &amp; Phrase Localization Platform.  The data was scraped from g2.com, a popular platform for software and business solution reviews.
**Methodology**

The analysis is structured around 3 core components:

1. **Overall Performance and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends such as review volumes, rating distributions, and word cloud representations for positive aspects ("pros") to provide a clearer picture of user opinions.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews (positive, neutral, or negative).
3. **Topic Modeling**: Identifying recurring themes and topics within the reviews to highlight common user concerns or praise.
